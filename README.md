# Counterfactual-Analysis-for-Personalized-Medicine

This study leverages the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) dataset (International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium et al., 2009), which integrates clinical and genetic data from a diverse population, to address the complexities of warfarin dosing. By utilizing causal inference techniques, particularly counterfactual analysis, the research aims to estimate individual treatment effects and recommend personalized dosages. These methods enable the disentanglement of confounding factors and the prediction of outcomes under hypothetical scenarios, thereby advancing the field of personalized medicine.
