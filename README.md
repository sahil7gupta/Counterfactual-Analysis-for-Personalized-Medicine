# Counterfactual-Analysis-for-Personalized-Medicine

This study leverages the International Warfarin
Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) dataset (In-
ternational Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium
et al., 2009), which integrates clinical and genetic
data from a diverse population, to address the com-
plexities of warfarin dosing. By utilizing causal infer-
ence techniques, particularly counterfactual analysis,
the research aims to estimate individual treatment
effects and recommend personalized dosages. These
methods enable the disentanglement of confounding
factors and the prediction of outcomes under hypo-
thetical scenarios, thereby advancing the field of per-
sonalized medicine.
